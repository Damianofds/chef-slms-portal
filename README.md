# Chef NFMS portal cookbook

This repo contains all chef receipts and scripts to automatically deploy the NFMS system.

The scripts can be used in two different ways:

* Using Vagrant in order to run the deployment process on a standard VM using VirtualBox
* Running the chef process on an external VM in order to use your favourite virtualization system
