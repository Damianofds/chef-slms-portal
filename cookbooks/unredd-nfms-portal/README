TODO:
  - Tomcat webapps are deployed in the webapps directory every time chef runs -  check if the webapp version is new and deploy only in that case
  - put users and passwords in node parameters
  - lots of parameters (geostore user, db user, passwords, urls, install directories, etc.) are hard coded, must be put in node attributes
  - put downloaded files in another dir but /tmp
  - add apache proxy directives from definition (geobatch.rb, geoserver.rb, and geostore.rb)
  + Setup mod_proxy - now it blocks everything


geostore users are initialized to:
user                                                     role  pwd
node['unredd-nfms-portal']['stg_geostore']['web_admin_user'] ADMIN node['unredd-nfms-portal']['stg_geostore']['web_admin_password']
user                                                     USER  node['unredd-nfms-portal']['stg_geostore']['web_admin_password']

Please note that the user password is the same as the admin one
