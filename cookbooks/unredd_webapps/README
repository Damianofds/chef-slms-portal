TODO:
  - check if the webapp version is new and deploy only in that case
  - lots of repetitions - refactor, especially in deploy_geostores.rb
  - put users and passwords in node parameters
  - lots of parameters (geostore user, db user, passwords, urls, install directories, etc.) are hard coded, must be put in node attributes
  - put downloaded files in another dir but /tmp
